# nix-clawdis

Declarative Nix packaging + configuration for Clawdis (macOS-first).

## Status

Draft RFC in `docs/rfc/2026-01-02-declarative-clawdis-nix.md`. Implementation is in progress.

## Goals

- Batteries-included defaults with a technically light configuration surface
- Telegram-first quick start
- Clear troubleshooting and “zero to Clawdis” onboarding

## Coming soon

- Nix flake with package + Home Manager module
- Quickstart docs and agent copypasta
- Guided setup app
